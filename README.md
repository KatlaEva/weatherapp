# Katla's weather forecast

This is a simple weather forcast app that uses a 5 day/3 hour forecast data from www.openweathermap.org. First users will se a simple display with todays weather data and after that a table with a 5 day forecast. Users are able to click on each day in the table to see detailed weather informaiton displayed with 3 hour intervals. In the navigation bar users are able to search for a city and see a weather forcast for a specific location.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
